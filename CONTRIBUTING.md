## Contributing

Hi there! I am glad that you're considering contributing to this project. Your efforts mean a lot for this repository and it's sustainability.

We have a simple pull request process that all contributors are required to comply with.

### Pull Request Process

1. Firstly, make sure the repository is forked and cloned on your system. This will allow for smooth and error-free development.

2. Make sure to use <b>g++</b> command-line compilation to run your code. This ensures consistency across platforms.

3. Since we are developing the library to be accessible for most computers, we require you to use standard libraries such as STL or common cross-platform libraries such as <i>iostream</i>. Avoid using platform-specific libraries such as Windows.h.

4. You may create a pull-request once you are completely satisfied with your contribution. The format of merge request should be "Added [insert what you have added]". Emojis are fine as long as they are not profane.

Try to follow <a href="https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">good commit message</a> guidelines.
